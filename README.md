<!-- SPONSORS_BEGIN -->

## Crowd-funded open-source software

**For the original creators please donate**

Take this software and use it as the starting point to build your project. Go
make some money, and [give something back](https://graphile.org/sponsor/) to
support us building more tools and kits for the Node, GraphQL and PostgreSQL
ecosystems. We have made this project available under the simple and liberal MIT
license to give you to a huge amount of freedom in how you use it, but this
isn't possible without the help of our wonderful sponsors.

We need more people to join our sponsors so we can continue to bring about
awesome projects like this. We'd love to spend more time on open source,
building tools that will save you and others even more time and money â”€ please
sponsor our open source efforts:
